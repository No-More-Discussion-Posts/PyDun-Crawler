# Ideas
3 rooms for tutorial in a row

player starts with different item every time

player starts in middle room, can go left or right

player has free roam (turn based movement), until runs into enemy (turns into turned based combat like pokemon)

need system for collisions with enemies and obstacles

stats - health, attack, defense  (keep it simple)

player always goes first for turns
